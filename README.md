## 🔬 End-to-End Project Workflow & Architecture

### EDA & Advanced Feature Engineering
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Cleaned and processed raw multi-omic datasets, reducing **694 initial features** down to a highly optimized and predictive subset containing **21 clinical features, 50 genes, and 18 mutated features**.
* **Feature Selection Techniques:** Applied statistical feature engineering, model-based feature selection, and ANOVA tests to isolate the most clinically relevant biomarkers.

###  Multi-Modal Survival Analysis (`lifelines`)
* **Clinical-Only Baseline:** Modeled patient survival probabilities utilizing standard clinical parameters using the `lifelines` library.
* **Multi-Modal Integration:** Evaluated shifts and performance changes in survival predictions upon combining clinical metrics with genomic and mutation profiles.

###  Subtype Classification Pipeline
Trained and benchmarked multiple state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for robust breast cancer subtype classification:
* **Logistic Regression**
* **Random Forest**
* **XGBoost**
* **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

### Cloud Database Integration
* Securely connected with **Azure Cosmos DB** to dynamically fetch, manage, and store patient records and analytical insights in real time.

###  Patient-Centric Predictive Insights
* Generates granular, individual-level predictions for both patient survival probabilities and molecular subtypes through an intuitive interface.

### Explainablity with SHAP
* Integrated **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to ensure clinical transparency, utilizing:
  * **Bar Plots** for global feature importance.
  * **Decision Plots** for multi-feature pathway evaluations.
  * **Force Plots** for individualized patient prediction breakdowns.
